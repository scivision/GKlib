# GKlib

Karypis lab GKlib buildable on modern computers and CMake

Copied from METIS v5.1.0.
For METIS v5.2.x, upstream METIS put GKlib in the [GKlib repo](https://github.com/KarypisLab/GKlib), but it isn't buildable on modern CMake in general. As a temporary workaround, we copied out GKlib from METIS 5.1.0 here.
